ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Kyrillos
**I am passionate about learning everything related to computer science and software programming. Also, since high school, I have been passionate about computers, but I was stopped a little bit by the choice available to study literary studies in high school. However my curiosity made me go deeper through the Internet. I took several courses and read several articles. I even created my own software programs, and now I am excited about the "Flutter Framework".**
